Used the relation between n and time derived with the big-O scaling in part 1:
	dt = t0(n=1000)/n^3
	dt = 3.6093750000000000/1000^3
	So, (n^3)*dt = computation time for size n

For n = 10000, computation time = 3609 seconds
For n = 100000, computation time = 3609375 seconds or approx. 1 hour

10000*10000*8 bytes = 800 MB
100000*100000*8 bytes = 80 GB
