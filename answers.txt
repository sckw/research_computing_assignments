1. How many earthquakes are listed in the table?

   $ tail -n +2 signif.txt.tsv | wc -l
   5958 earthquakes

2. How many columns are in the table?

   $ head -n 1 signif.txt.tsv | wc -w
   47 columns

3. Use the cut command to create a new file that just has the data from the columns for YEAR, EQ_PRIMARY and COUNTRY. Hint: you can get the column numbers by using the head command to view the first row and then visually count the column numbers for the above fields (there is also a unix command to do this, but we didn't cover it in class). Call the new data file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv'. You can use 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv' for the rest of the exercises below.

   $ cut -f 3,10,18 signif.txt.tsv > Year_Mag_Country.tsv
    (Column No.'s are: 3, 10, 18)

4. EQ_PRIMARY is the assigned earthquake magnitude. With your new file 'Year_Mag_Country.tsv', sort the data based on the numeric value of the EQ_PRIMARY column, then list the lines for the top ten largest earthquakes.

  $ sort -r -n -k 2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | head
  1960     9.5    CHILE
  1964     9.2    USA
  2011     9.1    JAPAN
  2004     9.1    INDONESIA
  1952     9.0    RUSSIA
  1700     9.0    USA
  2010     8.8    CHILE
  1812     8.8    USA
  1716     8.8    PERU
  1965     8.7    USA

5. How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this question.

  !!!!NOT SURE WHAT IS MEANT BY UNIQUE HERE!!!!
  $ cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
  154 countries in total
  (The above command sequence could neglect the "-c" option for uniq, and still get the same result.)

  $ cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort -R | uniq -u | wc -l
  31 unique countries

6. Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the data base are located in the USA or USA TERRITORY

  $ grep -w -i "USA" Year_Mag_Country.tsv | wc -l
  294 earthquakes located in the USA or USA TERRITORY

7. Expanding on the previous exercise, refine your command sequence so that it only counts earthquakes in the USA and not ones in USA TERRITORY. Hint: use the -v argument with grep and you may need to call grep more than once.

  $ grep -w -i "USA" Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep -v -i "Territory" | wc -l
  255 earthquakes located in the USA only.

8. Compute the total number of earthquakes in each country and then display the top ten countries along with the number of earthquakes. Hint: this can be done with a command sequence similar to exercise 5, but requires a specific argument to be used with uniq.

  !!!!VAGUE QUESTION, "top ten" of default order, or "top ten" when sorted by number of earthquakes?!!!!
  $ cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | head
     56 AFGHANISTAN
     53 ALBANIA
     55 ALGERIA
      4 ANTARCTICA
      3 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
     20 ARGENTINA
     13 ARMENIA
      5 ATLANTIC OCEAN
     23 AUSTRALIA
      7 AUSTRIA

  $ cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | head
    579 CHINA
    400 JAPAN
    365 IRAN
    363 INDONESIA
    324 ITALY
    319 TURKEY
    259 GREECE
    255 USA
    207 PHILIPPINES
    193 MEXICO

9. Create a shell script named countEq.sh that returns the total number of earthquakes for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Hint: see the Shell Script notes and use the special variable $1. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country USA.

  $ vi countEq.sh

  ***countEq.sh script below***
  #Type country name in quotation marks.
  cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | grep -w -i "$1"
  *****************************

  $bash countEq.sh USA
    255 USA
     39 USA TERRITORY

10. Create a shell script named countEq_getLargestEq.sh that returns both the total number of earthquakes AND the largest earthquake for a given country, where the country is specified as the option when calling the script. Use the echo command before each command to create labels for each returned value. Paste your script below and give an example calling sequence for country CHILE.

  ***countEq_getLargestEq.sh script below***
  echo Total number of earthquakes in "$1": $(cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | grep -w -i "$1")
  echo Largest earthquake magnitude in "$1": $(cut-f 2,3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | grep -w -i "$1" | sort -n -r | head -n 1 | cut -f 1)
  ******************************************

  $ bash countEq_getLargestEq.sh "Chile"
  Total number of earthquakes in Chile: 192 CHILE
  Largest earthquake magnitude in Chile: 9.5

11. Compute the total number of earthquakes each year and then output a sorted list of the top ten years with the most earthquakes. Paste your command and the top ten list below.

$ cut -f 1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
     78 2004
     77 2008
     72 2003
     67 2007
     62 2010
     61 2006
     60 2009
     60 2005
     60 2002
     59 2011

12. Create a shell script that loops over the top ten years with the most earthquakes (from exercise 11), finds all the earthquakes for a given year and writes them to file named $YEAR-earthquakes.txt, where $YEAR is the for loop variable assigned from the top ten list. You code should output ten different files (one for each year in the top ten list). Hints: Take your answer from exercise 11 and extract the year column, then use this for the range in a for loop by inserting them like this for YEAR in $(insert code that lists top ten years here). The rest is just a grep and a redirect > to a file with the correct name.

#Outputs Year, Magnitude and Country of all earthquakes in YEAR.
*******SCRIPT below*********
for YEAR in $(cut -f 1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | uniq -c | sort -nr | head | cut -b 9-12)
do
  grep -w "$YEAR" Year_Mag_Country.tsv > $YEAR-earthquakes.txt
done
